            Introduction
            
            This project focuses on creating a structured and responsive website using HTML and CSS. The design ensures compatibility across both desktop and mobile devices. The website consists of multiple pages, including a Home Page, Project Page, Contact Page, Video Demo Page, and a Site Report Page. The styling is managed using separate CSS files for desktop and mobile, ensuring an optimized user experience.
            
            Website Structure
            
            The website is designed with different sections, each having a specific function:
                •	Navigation Bar: Contains links to different pages for easy access.
                •	Main Content Area: Displays relevant content based on the selected page.
                •	Footer: Includes copyright information.
            
            The HTML structure follows a well-organized format, with external CSS files applied for styling.
            
           <h2>HTML Implementation</h2>
            
            The website consists of multiple HTML files, each designed for different sections. Key features include:
                •	A responsive design, ensuring accessibility on both mobile and desktop.
                •	A structured navigation menu linking all pages.
                •	Semantic HTML tags to improve readability and accessibility.
            
            The Site Report Page is designed to showcase the overall project, highlighting the coding structure and styling methods.
            
           <h2>CSS Styling</h2> 
            
            The website utilizes two separate CSS files:
                1.	reportdesktop.css – Used for styling on larger screens (above 800px width).
                2.	reportmobile.css – Applied for screens smaller than 800px.
            
            Key CSS Features:
                •	Body Styling: Background color, margin settings, and font styles.
                •	Navigation Menu: Inline list items styled with hover effects for smooth transitions.
                •	Header & Footer: Fixed positioning for better user experience.
            
           <h2> Conclusion</h2>
            
            This project successfully demonstrates the creation of a responsive, well-structured website using HTML and CSS.
